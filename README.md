Minecraft-Launcher
==================
This is a very early version of my Minecraft Launcher

I will be using Tomsik68's [Minecraft Launcher API](https://github.com/tomsik68/mclauncher-api)

TODO
==================
- ☑ Create Basic GUI (Doesn't need to be fancy, yet)
- ☐ Login(Working On)
- ☐ Launching the Game
- ☐ Launch versions 1.6 and higher
- ☐ Use profiles and have ability to use multiple accounts
- ☑ Check Mojang Server Statuses at startup
